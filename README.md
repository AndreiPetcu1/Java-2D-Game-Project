# Java 2D Game Project
"The Royal Journey: Quest for Light" is a 2D top-down adventure-fighter game developed in Java, where the player controls Anduin, a fallen king fighting to reclaim his kingdom from the forces of darkness led by the 
evil Vorax. The game features dynamic level progression, interactive enemies, collectible items (coins, potions), and real-time combat. It includes a save/load system using SQLite, allowing players to resume from
their last checkpoint. Each level introduces new challenges: the first focuses on learning controls and collecting items; the second takes place in a maze filled with enemies; and the final level features an epic
boss battle. The game uses object-oriented design, sprite-based animations, and pathfinding logic. The interface includes menus for starting, loading, or exiting the game, along with intuitive in-game prompts for
player feedback. Upon defeating Vorax and collecting all required coins, the player sees a victory screen and their score is recorded in a ranking system.
